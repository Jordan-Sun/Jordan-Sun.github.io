## CSE 422S: Operating Systems Organization

Head TA, _Washington University in St. Louis, CSE Department_, 2022

This course involves a hands-on exploration of core OS abstractions, mechanisms and policies in the context of the Linux kernel. Readings, lecture material, studio exercises, and lab assignments are closely integrated in an active-learning environment in which students gain experience and proficiency writing OS code, as well as tracing and evaluating OS operations via user-level programs and kernel-level monitoring tools. Topics include: system calls, interrupt handling, kernel modules, concurrency and synchronization, proportional and priority-based scheduling of processes and threads, I/O facilities, memory management, virtual memory, device management, and file system organization.

## CSE 332S/504N: Object-Oriented Software Development Laboratory

TA, _Washington University in St. Louis, CSE Department_, 2021-2022

Intensive focus on practical aspects of designing, implementing and debugging object-oriented software. Topics covered include developing, documenting, and testing representative applications using object-oriented and generic frameworks and C++. Design and implementation based on frameworks are central themes to enable the construction of reusable, extensible, efficient, and maintainable software.

## CSE 247: Data Structures and Algorithms

TA, _Washington University in St. Louis, CSE Department_, 2020

Study of fundamental algorithms, data structures, and their effective use in a variety of applications. Emphasizes importance of data structure choice and implementation for obtaining the most efficient algorithm for solving a given problem. A key component of this course is worst-case asymptotic analysis, which provides a quick and simple method for determining the scalability and effectiveness of an algorithm.
