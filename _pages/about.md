I am a Ph.D. candidate studying Computer Science at Washington University in St. Louis, advised by [Christopher Gill](https://engineering.wustl.edu/faculty/Christopher-Gill.html) and [Roch Guerin](https://engineering.wustl.edu/faculty/Roch-Guerin.html). I earned Bachelor’s degrees in Computer Engineering and Computer Science in 2022 and a Master’s degree in Computer Science in 2023 both from Washington University in St. Louis. My research interests are in real-time systems and multi-processor scheduling.
