  abstract = {Many mixed-criticality system models drop all jobs of low-criticality tasks when a criticality mode switch occurs, ensuring that high-criticality tasks still can meet their deadlines in the new mode. However, this means that even important low-criticality tasks are discarded, which may not be acceptable in some systems in practice. This paper addresses that distinction between criticality and importance through a new Inelastic Graceful Earliest Deadline First with Virtual Deadlines (IG-EDF-VD) scheme that upon a criticality mode switch only discards the least important low-criticality tasks necessary to ensure feasibility. Moreover, we consider elastic scheduling within our mixed-criticality model (EG-EDF-VD), using compression of workload-elastic tasks’ utilizations (and, as a result, execution time budgets) to reduce further the number of low-criticality tasks that are dropped.},
